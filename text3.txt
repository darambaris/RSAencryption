You have my heart
And we'll never be world apart
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark, we can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath I'mma stick it out 'till the end

Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh
